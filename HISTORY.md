# Register updates

## Alpha9. Alpha register is open to feedback
September 2017

New fields have been added to the register in response to feedback received. The register is still open for further feedback.

The field ‘social-housing-provider-designation’ was added to record what type of organisation the provider is. Currently all providers are one of: profit, non-profit, or local authority. This field links to the new social housing provider designation register.

The field ‘social-housing-provider-legal-entity’ was also added to record the type of provider, in this case whether it is a company, charity, or a charitable/non-charitable trust. This field links to the new social housing provider legal entity register.

The field ‘organisation’ was added to link to other registers where a provider is represented. For example, any provider that is a local authority in England, Scotland or Wales is also represented in one of the registers local-authority-eng, local-authority-sct, or principal-local-authority.
